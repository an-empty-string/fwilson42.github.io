I don't actually know Befunge.

However, I am quite good with Python and Ruby -- I know enough of C, Java, JS,
and Rust anguages to work with them when it's needed. I've used the Flask
microframework for Python web apps, as well as its Ruby counterpart, Sinatra.

My team won $1,000 at Hack the North 2014 for dep10y, an application which
facilitated collaborative development of software with a streamlined deployment
process.

My team won MITRE CTF two years in a row (2013 and 2014). In addition, we
placed sixth in the 2014 picoCTF.
